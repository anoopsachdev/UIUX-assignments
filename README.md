# UI/UX Assignments

## 🌟 Overview

This repository serves as a centralized collection of various assignments, projects, and exercises completed for UI/UX (User Interface and User Experience) coursework or self-study.

The goal of this collection is to document the design thinking process, showcase the evolution of design skills, and provide a clear record of deliverables for key UI/UX concepts.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The assignments are organized into separate directories, typically named after the project or the core design task they address.

You will typically find the following structure within each assignment folder:

| Folder/File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[Assignment_Name_1]/` | Directory for a specific project (e.g., "Mobile App Redesign"). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `documentation/` | Contains research findings, user flows, site maps, design briefs, or case studies. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `wireframes/` | Low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes (e.g., sketch files, images). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `prototypes/` | Interactive prototypes or links to them (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD links, or HTML files). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `assets/` | Specific images, icons, or design components used in this project. |
| `[Assignment_Name_2]/` | Directory for another assignment (e.g., "E-commerce Website Audit"). |
| `style_guide/` | (If present) A folder containing shared design resources, color palettes, typography, and component libraries. |

**Example Folders (Based on Common UI/UX Curriculum):**
* `User_Research_Analysis`
* `Information_Architecture_Sitemaps`
* `High_Fidelity_Prototyping`
* `Usability_Test_Reports`
* `Responsive_Web_Design`

*Note: Please navigate the repository structure to see the exact names and contents of the folders.*

## 🛠️ Key Topics Covered

This repository demonstrates skills across various UI/UX disciplines, including:

* **User Research:** Conducting interviews, surveys, and competitive analysis.
* **Information Architecture (IA):** Creating site maps, content hierarchies, and card sorting results.
* **Interaction Design (IxD):** Developing user flows, journey maps, and wireframes.
* **Visual Design:** Applying principles of color, typography, and branding.
* **Prototyping:** Creating both static mockups and interactive prototypes (low- and high-fidelity).
* **Usability Testing:** Planning test scenarios, conducting sessions, and synthesizing results.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Designing with WCAG guidelines in mind.
